I pour it out for you, my baby, I'm a fool
Our love is new, I speak, I speak like you
No matter who you are, I imitate you
Cut my body open, bleed me dry
I’m a slaughtered pig and I'm happy to die

So sit down, let's eat
Fill your plate all up with meat
Crossing hands and touching feet

When you said I’m good in a bad, bad place
Eyes roll back from yours as I hid my pale face
Like marbles rolling around the brain
Like marbles again and again and again

I feel, I feel a new thing coming on
My love, my blood is blue

So sit down, let's eat
Fill your plate all up with meat
Crossing hands and touching feet

Black coffee
Sour taste on my tongue
I write funny and I can't relate
It's no fun

I feel, I feel a new thing coming on
My love, my blood is blue
